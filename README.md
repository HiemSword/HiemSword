### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Who are you?

You can call me Hiem. I'm your standard teenager that likes computers and stuff

#### What are you working on currently?

I'm working on two projects currently:
- An Open source Discord bot written in Python (repository [here](https://github.com/nientedidecente/NDD-Bot))
- A silly blog about a person called "Re della Sintassi"
- A game on the Godot Game Engine

#### What is this "Re della sintassi"?

Re della sintassi (in english King of Syntax) is a fictional character that I use to do or write silly and funny things

Unfortunately it's only "fun" in Italian

If you want to look at the code, the repository is [here](https://github.com/HiemSword/regnodellasintassi-site)
